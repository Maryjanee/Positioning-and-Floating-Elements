            Alan Guth was one of the first physicists to hypothesize the
            existence of inflation, which explains how the universe expanded so
            uniformly and so quickly in the instant after the Big Bang 13.8
            billion years ago...

            <span class="uppercase">cambridge,</span> Mass. — One night late in
            1979, an itinerant young physicist named Alan Guth, with a new son
            and a year’s appointment at Stanford, stayed up late with his
            notebook and equations, venturing far beyond the world of known
            physics.

            He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic
            particles that should have been created in the Big Bang. Instead he
            discovered what might have made the universe bang to begin with. A
            potential hitch in the presumed course of cosmic evolution could
            have infused space itself with a special energy that exerted a
            repulsive force, causing the universe to swell faster than the speed
            of light for a prodigiously violent instant.

            If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the
            heavens look uniform from pole to pole and not like a jagged, warped
            mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out all the wrinkles and
            irregularities. Those particles were not missing, but would be
            diluted beyond detection, like spit in the ocean.

            On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers reported
            that they had seen the beginning of the Big Bang, and that his
            hypothesis, known undramatically as inflation, looked right.

            with telescopes at the South Pole, a team of astronomers led by John
            M. Kovac of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics detected
            ripples in the fabric of space-time — so-called
            <a href="#" class="article-links">gravitational waves</a> — the
            signature of a universe being wrenched violently apart when it was
            roughly a trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a second
            old. They are the long-sought smoking-gun evidence of inflation,
            proof, Dr. Kovac and his colleagues say, that Dr. Guth was correct.

            Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years, though
            many, including Dr. Guth, wondered whether it could ever be proved.
          </p>
          <p class="article-content">
            If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark in
            science comparable to the recent discovery of dark energy pushing
            the universe apart, or of the Big Bang itself. It would open vast
            realms of time and space and energy to science and speculation.
          </p>
          <p class="article-content">
            Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we see, extending
            14 billion light-years in space with its hundreds of billions of
            galaxies, is only an infinitesimal patch in a larger cosmos whose
            extent, architecture and fate are unknowable. Moreover, beyond our
            own universe there might be an endless number of other universes
            bubbling into frothy eternity, like a pot of pasta water boiling
            over.

            In our own universe, it would serve as a window into the forces
            operating at energies forever beyond the reach of particle
            accelerators on Earth and yield new insights into gravity itself.
            Dr. Kovac’s ripples would be the first direct observation of
            gravitational waves, which, according to Einstein’s theory of
            general relativity, should ruffle space-time.

            Marc Kamionkowski of Johns Hopkins University, an early-universe
            expert who was not part of the team, said, “This is huge, as big as
            it gets.”
          </p>
          <p class="article-content">
            He continued, “This is a signal from the very earliest universe,
            sending a telegram encoded in gravitational waves.”

          <p class="article-content">
            The ripples manifested themselves as faint spiral patterns in a bath
            of microwave radiation that permeates space and preserves a picture
            of the universe when it was 380,000 years old and as hot as the
            surface of the sun.

            Dr. Kovac and his collaborators, working in an experiment known as
            Bicep, for Background Imaging of Cosmic Extragalactic Polarization,
            reported their results in a scientific briefing at the Center for
            Astrophysics here on Monday and in a set of papers submitted to The
            Astrophysical Journal.

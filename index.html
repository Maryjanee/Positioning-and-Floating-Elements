            <span class="uppercase">cambridge,</span> Mass. — One night late in
            1979, an itinerant young physicist named Alan Guth, with a new son
            and a year’s appointment at Stanford, stayed up late with his
            notebook and equations, venturing far beyond the world of known

            He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic
            particles that should have been created in the Big Bang. Instead he
            discovered what might have made the universe bang to begin with. A
            potential hitch in the presumed course of cosmic evolution could
            have infused space itself with a special energy that exerted a
            repulsive force, causing the universe to swell faster than the speed
            of light for a prodigiously violent instant.

            irregularities. Those particles were not missing, but would be

            If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark in

            Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we see, extending

            extent, architecture and fate are unknowable. Moreover, beyond our
            own universe there might be an endless number of other universes
            bubbling into frothy eternity, like a pot of pasta water boiling

            Dr. Kovac’s ripples would be the first direct observation of

        <h3>The Theory of Inflation</h3>
        <p class="space-grid-description">
          Astronomers have found evidence to support the theory of inflation,
          which explains how the universe expanded so uniformly and so quickly
          in the instant after the Big Bang 13.8 billion years ago.

            <span class="uppercase">The Universe</span> is just under 14 billion
            years old. From our position in the Milky Way galaxy, we can observe
            a sphere that is now about 92 billion light-years across. But
            there's a mystery. Wherever we look, the universe has an even
            temperature.
          </p>
          <p class="space-grid-text">
            <span class="uppercase">Not enough time</span> The universe is not
            old enough for light to have traveled the vast distance from one
            side of the universe to the other, and there has not been enough
            time for scattered patches of hot and cold to mix into an even
            temperature.
          </p>
          <p class="space-grid-text">
            <span class="uppercase">Distant coffee</span> At a smaller scale,
            imagine using a telescope to look a mile in one direction. You see a
            coffee cup, and from the amount of steam, you can estimate its
            temperature and how much it has cooled.
          </p>
          <p class="space-grid-text">
            <span class="uppercase">coffee everywhere</span> Now turn around and
            look a mile in the other direction. You see a similar coffee cup, at
            exactly the same temperature. Coincidence? Maybe. But if you see a
            similar cup in every direction, you might want to look for another
            explanation.
          </p>
          <p class="space-grid-text">
            <span class="uppercase">still not enough time</span> There has not
            been enough time to carry coffee cups from place to place before
            they get cold. But if all the coffee cups were somehow filled from a
            single coffee pot, all at the same time, that might explain their
            even temperature.
          </p>
          <p class="space-grid-text">
            <span class="uppercase">inflation</span> solves this problem. The
            theory proposes that, less than a trillionth of a second after the
            Big Bang, the universe expanded faster than the speed of light. Tiny
            ripples in the violently expanding energy field eventually grew into
            the large-scale structures of the universe.
          </p>
          <p class="space-grid-text">
            <span class="uppercase">fluctuation</span> Astronomers have now
            detected evidence of these ancient fluctuations in swirls of
            polarized light in the cosmic background radiation, which is energy
            left over from the early universe. These are gravitational waves
            predicted by Einstein.
          </p>
          <p class="space-grid-text">
            <span class="uppercase">Expansion</span> Returning to our coffee,
            imagine a single, central pot expanding faster than light and
            cooling to an even temperature as it expands. That is something like
            inflation. And the structure of the universe mirrors the froth and
            foam of the original pot.
